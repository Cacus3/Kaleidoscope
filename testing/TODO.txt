Build System
============
Current behavior
- `make` builds googletest, common, kaleidoscope, and issue_840
  - This is intended :)
  - It is also intended that hello-simulator be omitted, since it has a test which is intended to fail to smoke test the framework
FIXED - `make clean` builds googletest, common, kaleidoscope, and issue_840, then manually runs make clean for each
  - Err... not intended


FIXED  - Ideally `make clean` would recursively invoke `make clean` or equivalent
FIXED - `make issue_840` (or another target in $(TEST_DIRS)) builds googletest, common, kaleidoscope, and issue_840
  - Not intended
  - Should just build googletest, common, and the target director (issue_840 in this case)
Desired (currently missing) behavior
- Support for docker as done for `make docker-simulator-tests`
  - I tried this, but wasn't able to get cmake (for googletest) to play well with Docker
Duplication of compiler flags across Makefiles under this directory
- Intended, but definitely shouldn't be in handwritten copies
Other duplication across Makefiles
- Intended, but already drifing; also, shouldn't be in manual copies
Duplication of delegate.mk
- Intended, to support invoking kaleidoscope-builder, but definitely shouldn't be manually copied

Directory structure
- Tests (e.g. testing/hello-simulator, testing/kaleidoscope, testing/issue_840) should be moved into a directory
  separate from test infrastructure, maybe just tests/
- Tests should be able to be organized in a hierarchical manner, eg
  - tests/regression/issue_blah
  - tests/hid/usb/bootkeyboard/foo
- Test infracture (now in testing/common/) should be moved into testing/ after the actual tests are moved out
- Test infrastructure should be able to be hierarchically organized
